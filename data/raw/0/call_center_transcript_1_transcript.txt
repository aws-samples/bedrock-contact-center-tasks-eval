A: I wanted to discuss our strategy around generative AI and how we should approach this emerging technology. As you know, several applications have captured a lot of attention recently. 
Action item: Set up a follow-up meeting to brainstorm ideas for where generative AI could be applicable in our products

B: Yes, generative AI is definitely a hot topic right now. All the major tech companies seem to be investing heavily in this space.
Action item: Research current generative AI initiatives at other tech companies to analyze the competitive landscape

A: Exactly. I think we need to have a plan here too or risk falling behind. What kind of applications do you see for generative AI in our products? Could it be used to automate certain processes or enhance our users' experience?
Action item: Outline high-level ideas for where generative AI could drive automation or enhance user experience in our products

C: There's certainly potential, but we'd need to proceed cautiously. While the capabilities are impressive, the technology still has problems with accuracy and bias that could negatively impact customers if we don't validate it thoroughly before rolling anything out.
Action item: Develop a validation framework to rigorously assess accuracy, ethics and safety of any generative AI applications we develop

B: I agree. We'll want to set clear guidelines for what generative AI should and
