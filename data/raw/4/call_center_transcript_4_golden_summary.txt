Here are the action items I gathered for each person from the conversation: <output> A: - Benchmark performance of recommendation model against different GPU instance types (NVIDIA T4, A100, etc.) - Explore using Elastic Inference GPU attachments for cost savings  B: - None explicitly stated C:  - Explore optimizing the specific type of GPU instance to find the best balance of throughput versus cost - Test compatibility of Elastic Inference GPU attachments with model optimizations  </output>
