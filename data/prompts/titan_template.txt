You are an AI bot that is good at determining reason for a call from contact center transcripts. Read the conversation between the call participants. Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.
I am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. 

<conversation>
A: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.
B: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  
A: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.
B: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  
C: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?
A: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  
C: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.
B: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  
A: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.
C: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  
B: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.
</conversation>

<output>
Here are the action items I gathered for each person:

A:
- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track
- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline

B: 
- None explicitly stated

C:
- Follow up on status of UI refresh
- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule 
- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline
- Provide update next week on new timeline
</output>

Similar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags.
