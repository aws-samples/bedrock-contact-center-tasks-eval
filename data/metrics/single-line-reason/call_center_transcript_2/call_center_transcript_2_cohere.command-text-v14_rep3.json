  "prompt": "You are an AI bot that is good at determining reason for a call from contact center transcripts. Read the conversation between the call participants. Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.\nI am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. \n\n<conversation>\nA: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.\nB: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  \nA: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.\nB: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  \nC: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?\nA: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  \nC: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.\nB: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  \nA: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.\nC: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  \nB: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.\n</conversation>\n\n<output>\nHere are the action items I gathered for each person:\n\nA:\n- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track\n- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline\n\nB: \n- None explicitly stated\n\nC:\n- Follow up on status of UI refresh\n- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule \n- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline\n- Provide update next week on new timeline\n</output>\n\nSimilar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags. \n\n<conversation>\nA: I wanted to discuss ideas for a new startup in the mobile gaming space. The success of companies like Angry Birds shows there is a lot of potential still untapped. \nAction item: Research recent trends and growth in mobile gaming to identify opportunities\n\nB: I agree mobile gaming is hot right now. Have you thought about potential types of games we could develop? Should we try freemium or paid apps?\nAction item: Outline pros and cons for freemium vs paid monetization models\n\nC: We should consider other business models too like in-game ads or sponsorships. The key is retaining users and driving high engagement.\nAction item: Explore in-game ad networks and pricing\nAction item: Brainstorm ideas to maximize user retention \n\nA: Those are good points. I also think we need to prototype game concepts quickly to validate demand before investing too heavily in development.\nAction item: Define process for rapidly prototyping and testing game concepts  \n\nB: Yes, we could even use some AI tools now to auto-generate simple game artwork and mechanics. This can help speed up testing. \nAction item: Evaluate AI-powered game prototyping tools to complement our development efforts\n\nC: Automating pieces through AI makes sense. Though we still need to ensure quality bar for any games we officially launch.\n\n</conversation>",
