  "prompt": "You are an AI bot that is good at determining reason for a call from contact center transcripts. Read the conversation between the call participants. Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.\nI am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. \n\n<conversation>\nA: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.\nB: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  \nA: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.\nB: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  \nC: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?\nA: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  \nC: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.\nB: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  \nA: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.\nC: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  \nB: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.\n</conversation>\n\n<output>\nHere are the action items I gathered for each person:\n\nA:\n- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track\n- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline\n\nB: \n- None explicitly stated\n\nC:\n- Follow up on status of UI refresh\n- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule \n- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline\n- Provide update next week on new timeline\n</output>\n\nSimilar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags. \n\n<conversation>\nA: I wanted to discuss ideas for a new startup in the mobile gaming space. The success of companies like Angry Birds shows there is a lot of potential still untapped. \nAction item: Research recent trends and growth in mobile gaming to identify opportunities\n\nB: I agree mobile gaming is hot right now. Have you thought about potential types of games we could develop? Should we try freemium or paid apps?\nAction item: Outline pros and cons for freemium vs paid monetization models\n\nC: We should consider other business models too like in-game ads or sponsorships. The key is retaining users and driving high engagement.\nAction item: Explore in-game ad networks and pricing\nAction item: Brainstorm ideas to maximize user retention \n\nA: Those are good points. I also think we need to prototype game concepts quickly to validate demand before investing too heavily in development.\nAction item: Define process for rapidly prototyping and testing game concepts  \n\nB: Yes, we could even use some AI tools now to auto-generate simple game artwork and mechanics. This can help speed up testing. \nAction item: Evaluate AI-powered game prototyping tools to complement our development efforts\n\nC: Automating pieces through AI makes sense. Though we still need to ensure quality bar for any games we officially launch.\n\n</conversation>",
  "completion": "<output>\nA: \n- Research mobile gaming trends and identify opportunities for startup\n- Define process for rapidly prototyping game concepts \n- Evaluate AI game prototyping tools\n\nB: \n- Outline pros and cons for freemium vs paid app monetization models\n\nC:\n- Explore in-game ad networks and sponsorship opportunities\n- Brainstorm ideas to improve user retention\n- Evaluate AI tools for rapid game prototyping and artwork creation\n</output>\n\nWhoever is responsible for creating action items out of the conversation had the responsibility of assigning action items and making sure they got assigned to the right person. In this conversation, creating action items was a collective responsibility, with each participant assigning some to themselves. The conversation also resulted in a comprehensive list of action items that covered a wide range of topics, from market research to specific next steps in the development process. It is important to make sure the action items are clear, specific, and actionable to increase the chances of follow-through and successful project implementation.",
