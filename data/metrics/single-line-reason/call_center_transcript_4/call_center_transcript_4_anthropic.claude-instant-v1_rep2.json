Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.\nI am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. \n\n<conversation>\nA: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.\nB: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  \nA: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.\nB: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  \nC: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?\nA: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  \nC: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.\nB: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  \nA: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.\nC: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  \nB: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.\n</conversation>\n\n<output>\nHere are the action items I gathered for each person:\n\nA:\n- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track\n- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline\n\nB: \n- None explicitly stated\n\nC:\n- Follow up on status of UI refresh\n- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule \n- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline\n- Provide update next week on new timeline\n</output>\n\nSimilar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags. \n\n<conversation>\nA: I wanted to further discuss options for the optimal cloud instance type to host our new product recommendation model. As a refresher on the requirements - this model will be query intensive, with thousands of customers hitting the prediction API simultaneously. And it relies on a large deep neural network for the recommendations. \n\nB: Yes, we should go through the pros and cons again of the main instance family options available. For standard instance types without GPUs, we'd likely need to go with a high CPU and memory specification to handle the computation and concurrency needs.\n\nC: Standard instances would be more cost-effective, but prediction latency would suffer without GPU acceleration. The neural network calculations could be 5-10x slower based on our initial benchmarks. For a customer-facing model, slow predictions could lead to poor user experience.\n\nA: That's a very good point. While GPU-powered instances would be more expensive, the business value of sub-second prediction latency for users is high. We want customers to get engaging, personalized recommendations immediately to drive conversions.\n\nB: I agree, I think GPU acceleration makes more sense despite the increased cloud costs. In addition to the deep learning performance boost, some of the other model parallelization and tuning optimizations we're doing would also run faster on GPUs.\n\nC: It seems like GPU instances are the way to go then as long as the total monthly cost is affordable. However, we may be able to optimize the specific type of GPU instance to find the best balance of throughput versus cost. \n\nA: Definitely, the major cloud providers offer an array of GPU instance types optimized for different use cases. We should benchmark performance against our workload with NVIDIA T4 GPUs, which are cost-optimized options, as well as some higher-end options like A100 GPUs.\n\nC: Do you think we should also explore using something like Elastic Inference GPU attachments? Those let you augment existing instances with fractional GPU access that is more cost-effective.\n\nB: Hmm good question. In theory that could work well for the cost-performance balance. We'd need to test compatibility with the types of GPU optimizations we're running in the model though...\n</conversation>\n\nAssistant:",
