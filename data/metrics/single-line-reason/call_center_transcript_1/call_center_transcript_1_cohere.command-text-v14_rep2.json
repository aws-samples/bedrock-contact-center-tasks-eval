  "prompt": "You are an AI bot that is good at determining reason for a call from contact center transcripts. Read the conversation between the call participants. Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.\nI am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. \n\n<conversation>\nA: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.\nB: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  \nA: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.\nB: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  \nC: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?\nA: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  \nC: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.\nB: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  \nA: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.\nC: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  \nB: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.\n</conversation>\n\n<output>\nHere are the action items I gathered for each person:\n\nA:\n- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track\n- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline\n\nB: \n- None explicitly stated\n\nC:\n- Follow up on status of UI refresh\n- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule \n- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline\n- Provide update next week on new timeline\n</output>\n\nSimilar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags. \n\n<conversation>\nA: I wanted to discuss our strategy around generative AI and how we should approach this emerging technology. As you know, several applications have captured a lot of attention recently. \nAction item: Set up a follow-up meeting to brainstorm ideas for where generative AI could be applicable in our products\n\nB: Yes, generative AI is definitely a hot topic right now. All the major tech companies seem to be investing heavily in this space.\nAction item: Research current generative AI initiatives at other tech companies to analyze the competitive landscape\n\nA: Exactly. I think we need to have a plan here too or risk falling behind. What kind of applications do you see for generative AI in our products? Could it be used to automate certain processes or enhance our users' experience?\nAction item: Outline high-level ideas for where generative AI could drive automation or enhance user experience in our products\n\nC: There's certainly potential, but we'd need to proceed cautiously. While the capabilities are impressive, the technology still has problems with accuracy and bias that could negatively impact customers if we don't validate it thoroughly before rolling anything out.\nAction item: Develop a validation framework to rigorously assess accuracy, ethics and safety of any generative AI applications we develop\n\nB: I agree. We'll want to set clear guidelines for what generative AI should and\n</conversation>",
  "completion": "<output>\nA: \n- Follow up on the generative AI idea and set up a meeting to brainstorm ideas \n- Participate in the brainstorming session to contribute ideas for AI applicability \n- Review ideas from the meeting and identify top opportunities for applying AI \n\nB: \n- Research tech company initiatives in generative AI to inform competitive landscape understanding \n- Share research findings and analysis with the team \n\nC:\n- Outline the potential risks of generative AI and propose a validation framework to assess accuracy and ethics \n- Collaborate with relevant teams to develop the framework and ensure thorough testing of all AI initiatives \n\n</output>\n\nWhoever is responsible for taking notes during meetings or following up afterwards should compile the list of action items and ensure each member is aware of their deliverables and deadlines to ensure efficient execution. This list can also be used to track progress on the discussed topics and ensure the team follows up on the generative AI discussion.",
