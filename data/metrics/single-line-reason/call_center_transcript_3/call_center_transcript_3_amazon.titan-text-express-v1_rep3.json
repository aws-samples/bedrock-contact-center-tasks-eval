  "prompt": "You are an AI bot that is good at determining reason for a call from contact center transcripts. Read the conversation between the call participants. Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.\nI am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. \n\n<conversation>\nA: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.\nB: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  \nA: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.\nB: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  \nC: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?\nA: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  \nC: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.\nB: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  \nA: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.\nC: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  \nB: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.\n</conversation>\n\n<output>\nHere are the action items I gathered for each person:\n\nA:\n- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track\n- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline\n\nB: \n- None explicitly stated\n\nC:\n- Follow up on status of UI refresh\n- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule \n- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline\n- Provide update next week on new timeline\n</output>\n\nSimilar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags. \n\n\\n\\n\n<conversation>\nA: I wanted to have a broader discussion on responsible AI development principles. As we build more AI models, how do we ensure they are helpful, harmless, and aligned with human values?\n\nB: This is an important topic. We need to make ethical considerations a priority from the beginning of any AI project, not an afterthought. I think we should develop a review process focused on safety for all new models. \n\nAction item: Draft a proposal for an AI model safety review framework \n\nC: I agree. We should analyze potential risks like data bias and misuse upfront. Models also need to be secure - what if they were hacked?\n\nAction item: Outline additional potential safety risks to address such as data/algorithm bias and security\n\nA: Valid points. Besides analyzing risks, we also need to ensure the objectives we give AI align with human values more broadly. Like being helpful to users, not just maximizing some narrow metric. \n\nAction item: Explore methodologies for value alignment in AI systems\n\nB: The objectives point connects to transparency too. Any AI decisions that impact users should be explainable. If we can't understand why an AI did something, we can't verify it's aligned.  \n\nAction item: Research existing XAI (explainable AI) techniques to augment our models\n\nC: Adding explainability makes sense. We should also discuss how to carefully test models before launch to catch additional issues. And have a plan to monitor their impacts over time.\n\nAction item: Develop testing and monitoring standards for AI models based on industry best practices\n\nA: Great suggestions all around. It seems like we have a blueprint to make responsibility, safety and ethics central to our AI efforts here. I'm optimistic if we build these considerations in from the start, we can drive real progress. Does anyone have any other thoughts before we break?\n</conversation>",
