  "prompt": "You are an AI bot that is good at determining reason for a call from contact center transcripts. Read the conversation between the call participants. Based on the participants of the call discuss, create a list of action items for each speaker in the call transcript.\nI am giving you an example of a conversation and the desired output below. \n\n<conversation>\nA: Hi folks, I wanted to discuss the timeline for launching the new app update.\nB: Sure A, what aspect did you want to talk through?  \nA: I'm mostly concerned that some of the new features seem to be falling behind schedule based on the updates I'm getting from the teams.\nB: Okay, let me loop in C since she's managing the development roadmap.  \nC: Hey all, thanks for bringing this up. What features are you worried about A?\nA: The new recommendation algorithm integration seems pretty delayed based on what engineering told me. Also the UI refresh.  \nC: You're right, the algorithm work is a bit backed up. As for the UI, I'll follow up - I thought that was on track.\nB: Maybe we should prioritize getting the algorithm piece back on schedule since that's key for our main app update goal.  \nA: Agreed. C, can you work with engineering on that? And B, to your point, I'm happy to help re-prioritize other things if needed.\nC: Sure, I'll sync up with engineering today and get a plan to get us back on track.  \nB: Sounds good, let's plan to regroup next week once you have an update.\n</conversation>\n\n<output>\nHere are the action items I gathered for each person:\n\nA:\n- Help re-prioritize other workstreams if needed to get algorithm integration back on track\n- Regroup next week for an update on new timeline\n\nB: \n- None explicitly stated\n\nC:\n- Follow up on status of UI refresh\n- Work with engineering team to get recommendation algorithm integration back on schedule \n- Sync up with engineering today and come up with updated timeline\n- Provide update next week on new timeline\n</output>\n\nSimilar to the above example generate a list of action items for each speaker from the conversation provided below. Put the action items between the <output></output> tags. \n\n\\n\\n\n<conversation>\nMeeting transcript: \nA: Hi B, I want to discuss the workstream for our new product launch\nB: Sure A, is there anything in particular you want to discuss?\nA: Yes, I want to talk about how users enter into the product.  \nB: Ok, in that case let me add in C.\nC: Hey everyone\nB: Hi C, A wants to discuss how users enter into the product.\nA: its too complicated and we should remove friction.  for example, why do I need to fill out additional forms? I also find it difficult to find where to access the product when I first land on the landing page.  \nB: I would also add that I think there are too many steps.\nC: Ok, I can work on the landing page to make the product more discoverable but B can you work on the additonal forms?\nB: Yes but I would need to work with James from another team as he needs to unblock the sign up workflow. A can you document any other concerns so that I can discuss with James only once?\nA: Sure.\n</conversation>",
