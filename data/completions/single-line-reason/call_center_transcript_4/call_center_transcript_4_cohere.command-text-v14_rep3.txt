Here are some action items for each speaker:

A:
- Lead a discussion on requirements and options for the optimal cloud instance type for the new product recommendation model
- Highlight the need for a high CPU and memory specification to handle the computation and concurrency needs without GPU acceleration

B:
- Provide technical expertise on the pros and cons of different instance family options available
- Confirm the potential latency implications of standard instances without GPU acceleration

C:
- Highlight the potential for slower neural network calculations with standard instances 
- Raise concerns about the potential for slower model optimizations on standard instances 

Does this help outline some key action items for each speaker? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of the items.
