Here are the action items for each speaker:

A:
- Lead a discussion on the requirements of the product recommendation model
- Evaluate the optimal cloud instance type that can handle thousands of customers 
- Assess the pros and cons of standard instance types without GPUs and their ability to handle computation and concurrency needs

B:
- Provide expertise on the performance boost of GPU acceleration and the potential for model optimizations 
- Help assess the impact of prediction latency on the user experience 

C:
- Offer insights on cost-effective options such as Elastic Inference GPU attachments 
- Lead the exploration of different GPU instance types and their compatibility with model optimizations
