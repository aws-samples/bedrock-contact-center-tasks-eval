Here are the action items I gathered for each person:

A:
- Evaluate cost-optimized GPU instance types like NVIDIA T4 GPUs and higher-end options like A100 GPUs for benchmarking performance against workload
- Explore using Elastic Inference GPU attachments for cost-effective GPU access
- Determine compatibility with model's GPU optimizations

B:
- None explicitly stated

C:
- Research and compare different GPU instance types from major cloud providers
- Benchmark performance with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and higher-end options
- Explore compatibility with model's GPU optimizations
- Recommend optimal GPU instance type based on cost-performance analysis
- Prepare cost estimates and present findings to stakeholders for decision-making
