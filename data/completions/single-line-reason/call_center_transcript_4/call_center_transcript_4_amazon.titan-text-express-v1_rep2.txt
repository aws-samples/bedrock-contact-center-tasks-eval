A:
- Evaluate cost-optimized GPU instance types like NVIDIA T4 GPUs and higher-end options like A100 GPUs for benchmarking performance against workload
- Explore using Elastic Inference GPU attachments for cost-effective GPU access
- Determine compatibility with model's GPU optimizations

B:
- None explicitly stated

C:
- Research and evaluate cost-optimized GPU instance types like NVIDIA T4 GPUs and higher-end options like A100 GPUs for benchmarking performance against workload
- Explore using Elastic Inference GPU attachments for cost-effective GPU access
- Determine compatibility with model's GPU optimizations
- Recommend the optimal cloud instance type based on cost, performance, and compatibility requirements
- Prepare cost estimates and present findings to stakeholders for decision-making
