Here are some action items for each speaker:

A:
- Lead a discussion on the requirements of the product recommendation model
- Assess the potential of different cloud instance types to host the model (including standard vs GPU-powered instances)
- Take into account the cost-effectiveness and performance of each option 
- Suggest possible options for benchmarking, based on the requirements and needs of the model

B:
- Provide technical expertise on the potential pros and cons of different cloud instance options
- Offer insights on how different instance types could optimize or hinder model performance 
- Collaborate on assessing the business implications of model performance versus cost implications

C:
- Highlight the potential drawbacks of different options (such as the increased latency of standard instances without GPU acceleration) 
- Offer to contribute to any benchmarking tests proposed by A 
- Lead any subsequent discussions on possible ways to optimize different options


Would you like me to elaborate on any of these action items?
