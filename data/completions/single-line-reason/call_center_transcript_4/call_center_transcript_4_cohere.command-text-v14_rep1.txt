Here are the action items for each speaker:

A:
- Lead a discussion on the requirements of the product recommendation model
- Evaluate the optimal cloud instance type that can handle thousands of customers 
- Assess the pros and cons of standard instance types without GPUs and their ability to handle computation and concurrency needs

B:
- Provide information on the different instance types available and their potential impact on the model 
- Help evaluate the option of GPU-powered instances and their potential boost to performance 

C:
- Outline the potential for increased prediction latency with standard instances and its impact on user experience 
- Highlight the potential cost savings of Elastic Inference GPU attachments and test compatibility with the types of GPU optimizations being used 

Would you like me to generate any other lists of action items based on conversation transcripts?
