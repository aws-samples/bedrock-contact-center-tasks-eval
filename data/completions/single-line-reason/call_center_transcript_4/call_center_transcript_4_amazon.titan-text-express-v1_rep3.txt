Here are the action items I gathered for each person:

A:
- Evaluate the performance of NVIDIA T4 GPUs and higher-end options like A100 GPUs for the product recommendation model workload
- Explore using Elastic Inference GPU attachments for cost-effective GPU access
- Benchmark performance with different instance types and configurations to find the optimal balance of throughput and cost

B:
- Research and test compatibility of Elastic Inference GPU attachments with the model's GPU optimizations
- Provide recommendations on the optimal instance type and configuration based on performance benchmarks and cost considerations

C:
- Research and compare different GPU instance types offered by major cloud providers
- Provide recommendations on the optimal instance type and configuration based on performance benchmarks and cost considerations
- Assist in benchmarking and testing the performance of Elastic Inference GPU attachments with the model workload
