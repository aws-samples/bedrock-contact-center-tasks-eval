Here are the action items I gathered for each person:

A:
- Evaluate the cost-performance balance of different GPU instance types (NVIDIA T4, A100, etc.) for hosting the new product recommendation model
- Benchmark performance against the workload with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and higher-end options
- Explore using Elastic Inference GPU attachments for cost-effective GPU access
- Determine compatibility with the model's GPU optimizations

B:
- Research and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of GPU-powered instances for the specific workload
- Collaborate with the data science team to optimize the model for GPU acceleration
- Consider using Elastic Inference GPU attachments if they are compatible with the model's optimizations
- Provide recommendations to the leadership team on the optimal cloud instance type for hosting the product recommendation model

C:
- Collaborate with the data science team to identify the specific type of GPU instance that would provide the best balance of throughput and cost for the product recommendation model
- Benchmark performance of different GPU instance types with the model's workload
- Provide recommendations to the leadership team on the optimal GPU instance type and cost-saving strategies
